I summon my super bravery and walk up to Parker.  "If you aren't nice to us, we won't play with you!" I say.

"Yeah!" Jakey says.

Then, Maddy, Micah and Josh say that they won't play with him either if he isn't nice.

Parker is surprised.  "I don't care," he says.  "Don't play."

We all go over to the next field to start a new game.  Just before we start, Maddy gives me a hug.  "Thank for standing up for me, Danny!"

But then I see Parker all alone.  I know I'd feel sad if I didn't have anyone to play with.  Maybe Parker just needs a friend.
