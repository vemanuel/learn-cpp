But then, Maddy and Jakey come and sit next to me like nothing ever happened.
"Hey," I say.  "So I guess Leo's your new best friend now."
"No way, Danny," Maddy says.  "You'll always be our best friend.  We just saw that Leo was really sad because he forgot his lunch at home.  So we offered him some of our food."
"Oh," I say.  Maybe if I would have used my POWER TO CHOOSE to ask Leo what was wrong, I would have made the rest of my day way better.
