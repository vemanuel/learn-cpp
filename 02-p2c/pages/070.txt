I think about how scared Maddy must have been.
"I'm really sorry about not taking better care of Webster, Maddy."  I say when we walk out to lunch.
Maddy smiles.  "I forgive you.  I know you didn't do it on purpose."
I whisper, "Don't tell anyone, but I'm afraid of clowns."
She giggle and says, "Don't worry, I won't tell."
