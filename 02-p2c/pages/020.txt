There's no way I'll let Dr. Ninjario beat me!
I find my way through the laser beams and finally reach the ladder to the secret escape hatch..
Just then Mommy calls out, "Three minutes till the bus is here!"

Three minutes? Aw, man.  Dr. Ninjario had me tangled in a time warp!

I hurry to get dressed, but finding my other shoe takes forever.
