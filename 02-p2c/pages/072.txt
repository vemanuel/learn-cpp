Maddy runs to the bathroom crying.
After a minute, Parker is guarding me.  I get so scared that I freeze.  He steals the ball, then scores a goal.
"Ha! Danny, you must be the worst player in the whole school," he says.  "You should stay off the field forever."
Tears come to my eyes.  I run away to hide before Parker can see.
I'm embarrassed for letting him push me around.  I don't feel like such a superhero.
I stay in my hiding spot until recess is over.
