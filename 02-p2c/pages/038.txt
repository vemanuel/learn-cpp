Later at recess, I run straight out to the soocer field.
Uh-oh, Parker is playing.  I'm a little scared of him.

We start the game, and Parker quickly scores three goals on Albert.
"Haha! Three goals in three minutes!" he says.
"You're the worst goalie ever!
Albert cries and runs off the field.
