Oh, no! This morning I was caught by the evil Dr. Ninjario!
But have no fear. After a hundred thousand minutes, I'm finally on the brink of escaping.
His laser beam dungeon is no match for me!

"Danny, it's time to get ready for school!" Mommy calls out.

Aw, man! I'm busy trying to escape from Dr. Ninjario! If I stop now, I may never get out!
