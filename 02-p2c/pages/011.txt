I dribble straight to the three-point line and throw the ball up towards the basket.
If I make this shot, we'll win the game!

The bell rings as the ball flies through the air.
Everyone watches and holds their breath.
The ball rolls around the rim, but flies out.
Aw, man! So close!

Jonah breathes a sigh of relief as we walk to class.
"You played great, Danny," he says.
"I didn't think your team had a chance, but you almost won at the buzzer."

"Thanks," I say.

I'm happy I decided to play instead of give up.
