When I get home, I show Mommy the note.
"Some of the world's smartest people ask the most questions," she says to me.  "You should never be embarrassed that you're trying to learn something."
I turn on my super focus, and Mommy shows me how to use a number line.  Now I have to do the worksheets.  If I would have asked Ms. Blakely that question in class, I think it would have saved me a lot of time.
