After recess Maddy seems upset.
"I thought your spider would kill me" she says.
I laugh.  "Tarantulas can't kill you!"
"It's not funny, Danny! I don't want to play with you for the rest of the day." 
She stomps away.

Back in class, Ms. Blakely is teaching some new math.
I'm not in the mood.
I can't stop thinking about how mean Maddy was to me.
