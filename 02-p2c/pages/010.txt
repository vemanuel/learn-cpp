I call my team together. "I know they're good," I say. "But if we try our best, we can win!"

We start playing, and the game is super close.  With less than a minute left we're down by four points.  I get the ball and use my super speed to run to the hoop.  I jump super high and score! Yes! Now we're down by just two points.

Jonah takes the ball out, but Alexis steals it! She passes the ball to me. "Hurry, Danny!" she yells. "There isn't much time left."
