When I get home, I tell Mommy about how Webster got loose and how recess was super boring.
"It's a good thing you chose to apologize to Maddy," she says.  "Your day could have been much worse."
I think about everything that happened and how it may have been different if I made better choices.  I think tomorrow will be a better day if I use my POWER TO CHOOSE wisely.
