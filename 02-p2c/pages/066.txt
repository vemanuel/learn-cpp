Later, Daddy comes home from work.  "Cool volcano!" he says.  "Did you make it erupt in class?"
"No," I say.  "It was too hard."
"So , you couldn't get it to erupt yet," he says.  "But how about we give it another try?"
I think about how hard it was at school, but if the other kids could do it, I know I can too.
"I'd like that," I say.
Daddy prints out the instructions, and I get straight to work.  I turn on my super focus, and follow the instructions line by line.
