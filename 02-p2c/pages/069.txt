After school, Ms. Blakely wants to talk to me about the picture I drew.
"Some days you might feel like everything is going wrong, but you can always change that by making better choices.  Can you think of a time when you could have used your POWER TO CHOOSE wisely to improve your day?"
I think about how my recess could have been better if I would have played basketball, or how Maddy wouldn't be so upset with me if I would have apologized.
Now I know that using my POWER TO CHOOSE wisely is just as important at school as it is at home.  I wish I'd figured that out a little sooner.
