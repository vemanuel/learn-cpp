When I get home, Mommy asks me how my day was.
I tell her everything that happened.

"Sounds like your day was OK," she says.
"Do you think that was because of how you used your POWER TO CHOOSE?"

"I think so, I say.
"And if I use it even more wisely tomorrow, I might have an even better day."
